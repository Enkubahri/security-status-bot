## Bot Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
2. A **Telegram account**
3. Basic command line knowledge

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Choose a name for your bot (e.g., "Community Security Bot")
4. Choose a username for your bot (must end with 'bot', e.g., "community_security_bot")
5. Copy the bot token provided by BotFather

### Step 2: Get Your Telegram User ID

1. Send `/start` to your newly created bot
2. Use a bot like `@userinfobot` to get your Telegram User ID
3. Save this number - you'll need it for admin access

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the bot directory
cd security-status-bot

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your information:
   ```env
   # Your bot token from BotFather
   BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCdefGHijKLmnOPqrSTuvWXyz

   # Your Telegram User ID(s) - comma separated for multiple admins
   ADMIN_USER_IDS=123456789,987654321

   # Database file location
   DATABASE_PATH=security_reports.db
   ```

### Step 5: Run the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will start and display a message like:
```
INFO - Starting Security Status Bot...
INFO - Application started
```

### Step 6: Add the Bot to Your Group

1. Add your bot to your Telegram group
2. Make sure the bot has permission to send messages
3. Test the bot by sending `/start` in the group

## Usage Guide

### For Group Administrators

#### Adding Focal People
1. Send `/addfocal` command
2. Provide the Telegram User ID of the person
3. Provide their full name (alphabets and spaces only)
4. The person can now submit security reports

#### Managing Focal People
- Use `/listfocal` to see all authorized focal people
- Use `/removefocal` to remove someone's authorization
- Users can get their ID by sending `/start` to the bot privately

### For Focal People

#### Submitting Security Reports
1. Send `/report` command
2. Follow the guided process:
   - **Location**: Enter the area/location name (alphabets and spaces only)
   - **Status**: Describe the current security situation
   - **Recommended Action**: Suggest what community members should do

#### Example Report Flow
```
User: /report
Bot: Please provide the location/area name:

User: Downtown Market Area
Bot: Location: Downtown Market Area
     Now, please describe the security status:

User: Heavy police presence due to ongoing protests
Bot: Status: Heavy police presence due to ongoing protests
     Finally, please provide the recommended action:

User: Avoid the area until further notice
Bot: ‚úÖ Security Report Submitted Successfully!
     [Report details displayed]
```

### For All Group Members

#### Viewing Recent Reports
Send `/status` to see the latest 10 security reports with:
- Location
- Security status
- Recommended action
- Reporter name
- Timestamp

#### Searching by Location
Send `/location <area name>` to find reports for specific locations:
```
/location downtown
/location market area
/location central district
```

## Database Schema

The bot uses SQLite database with the following tables:

### security_reports
- `id`: Unique report identifier
- `location`: Area/location name
- `status`: Security status description
- `recommended_action`: Suggested actions
- `reporter_id`: Telegram User ID of reporter
- `reporter_name`: Name of reporter
- `timestamp`: When report was created
- `is_active`: Whether report is active

### focal_people
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `telegram_user_id`: Telegram User ID
- `name`: Full name
- `added_by`: Admin who added them
- `added_date`: When they were added
- `is_active`: Whether they're active

### admins
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `telegram_user_id`: Admin's Telegram User ID
- `added_date`: When admin was added

## Security Features

- **Input Validation**: Location and name fields only accept alphabets and spaces
- **Role-based Access**: Only focal people can submit reports
- **Admin Controls**: Only admins can manage focal people
- **Automatic Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps
- **Database Integrity**: SQLite with proper constraints and data types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"BOT_TOKEN not found" error**
   - Check your `.env` file exists and contains the correct bot token
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces around the token

2. **"Only authorized focal people can submit reports"**
   - The user needs to be added as a focal person by an admin
   - Use `/addfocal` command to add them

3. **Admin commands not working**
   - Verify your User ID is in the `ADMIN_USER_IDS` list
   - Make sure the User ID is correct (no extra characters)

4. **Bot not responding in group**
   - Check if bot has permission to send messages in the group
   - Try sending commands privately to the bot first

### Getting Help

1. Check the logs for error messages when running `python bot.py`
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Verify your `.env` file configuration
4. Test commands in a private chat with the bot first

   FLASK_PORT=5000
   FLASK_DEBUG=False
   
   # Domain where your Mini App is hosted
   WEBAPP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

### Mini App File Structure

```
webapp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Flask web application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Main Mini App interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css   # Styling for Mini App

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routes.py       # API endpoints for Mini App
```

### API Endpoints

The Mini App communicates with the bot through REST API endpoints:

- `GET /api/reports` - Get recent security reports
- `GET /api/reports/location/<location>` - Get reports by location
- `POST /api/reports` - Submit new security report (focal people only)
- `GET /api/focal-people` - List focal people (admin only)
- `POST /api/focal-people` - Add new focal person (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/focal-people/<id>` - Remove focal person (admin only)

## üöÄ Advanced Deployment

### Using Docker

1. **Create Dockerfile** (example provided in repository)
2. **Build the image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t security-status-bot .
   ```
3. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --env-file .env security-status-bot
   ```

### Using Heroku

1. **Create Heroku app**:
   ```bash
   heroku create your-security-bot
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   heroku config:set ADMIN_USER_IDS=your_user_id
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

### Production Considerations

- **Database**: Consider using PostgreSQL for production instead of SQLite
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Required for Telegram Mini Apps
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Logging**: Set up proper logging and monitoring
- **Backups**: Regular database backups for report data
- **Security**: Use secrets management for sensitive environment variables
